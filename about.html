    <h1 class="page-heading">About This Blog</h1>
    
    <p>
        This blog is dedicated to detailed explanations of LeetCode problem solutions. Each post provides:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The original problem statement</li>
        <li>A clear explanation of the approach used to solve it</li>
        <li>The complete Python code solution</li>
        <li>A detailed walkthrough of the code and its logic</li>
        <li>Time and space complexity analysis</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        All solutions are written in Python and automatically published when new solutions are pushed to the 
        <a href="https://github.com/chirag-shinde/leetcontentagent" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    
    <p>
        The content for this blog is automatically generated by a custom agent that:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Monitors the GitHub repository for new LeetCode solution pushes</li>
        <li>Analyzes the code to understand the approach</li>
        <li>Generates a detailed explanation with complexity analysis</li>
        <li>Creates and publishes a new blog post with the complete explanation</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        This automated process ensures that each solution is accompanied by a thorough explanation,
        making it easier to understand the thought process and implementation details.
