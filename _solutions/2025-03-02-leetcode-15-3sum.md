This solution to the 3Sum problem uses a sorting and two-pointer approach.

First, we sort the array, which takes O(n log n) time. This allows us to efficiently find triplets that sum to zero.

The main algorithm works as follows:

1. We iterate through each element `nums[i]` as a potential first element of the triplet.
2. For each `nums[i]`, we use two pointers `j` and `k` to find pairs that, combined with `nums[i]`, sum to zero.
3. The two pointers start at `i+1` and at the end of the array.
   - If the sum is zero, we've found a valid triplet.
   - If the sum is less than zero, we increment `j` to get a larger sum.
   - If the sum is greater than zero, we decrement `k` to get a smaller sum.

A key challenge in this problem is avoiding duplicate triplets. We handle this by:
1. Skipping duplicate values for the first element (`nums[i]`)
2. After finding a valid triplet, moving both `j` and `k` past any duplicate values

The time complexity is O(n²) because:
- Sorting takes O(n log n)
- The nested loops take O(n²) in the worst case (each element potentially considered with each other element)

The space complexity is O(log n) to O(n) for the sorting algorithm, depending on implementation.
